(Macroeconomics is the second-most important subject). In fact, even understanding the news each day often requires knowledge of microeconomics*.\n\n`Robert S. Pyndick and Daniel L. Rubinfeld (Microeconomics, 2018 p.15)`\n\n## News\n\n![](potret.png){.absolute top=200 left=0 width=\"350\" height=\"300\"}\n![](potret2.png){.absolute top=50 right=50 width=\"450\" height=\"250\"}\n\n![](potret3.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=50 width=\"400\" height=\"270\"}\n\n## Articles\n\n1.

Vol. 13.\n\n## Main Objective\n\n-   The eﬀects of physical appearance on labor market outcomes and economic success in general\n\n## Findings from 1\n\n-   Plain people earn less than average-looking people, who earn less than the good-looking.\n-   The plainness penalty is 5-10 percent,slightly larger than the beauty premium.\n-   Effects for men are at least as great as for women.\n-   Unattractive women have lower labor-force participation rates and marry men with less human capital\n\n## Findings from 2\n\n-   Beauty is not merely correlated with but actually causes differences in earnings.\n-   Possible causes:employer discrimination, customer discrimination\n-   Employer discrimination X.\n-   Clients prefer to engage with better-looking attorneys -> more attractive men obtain partnerships early.\n-   Workers choose type of work where the payoff to the characteristic with which they are relatively well endowed is the greatest\n\n## Findings from 3\n\n-   Billionaires are both more educated and better-looking than average for their age.\n-   Among billionaires, wealth is neither related to beauty nor to educational attainment.\n-   In contrast to the strong relationships between physical attractiveness, education and economic success generally.\n-   Statistical relationships that hold across broad populations may not persist within the extremes of the distribution.\n-   The ﬁndings suggest the powerful role of luck within the extremes of the distributions of economic outcomes.\n\n## Findings from 4\n\n-   Even among accounting ﬁrms, where professionalism is well deﬁned, discrimination against candidates based on traits exists.\n\n## Research Design\n\n-   What constitutes beauty...are there common agreements?\n    -   anthropologists, sociologists, social psychologists\n    -   few consistent standards across cultures\n    -   these standards change slowly\n-   Data: household surveys for US and Canada\n-   Interviewer rate the respondent's physical appearance\n-   Other demographics variables\n-   Regression\n\n## Replication\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = lwage ~ belavg + abvavg + exper + goodhlth + black + \n    female + married + south + bigcity + smllcity + service + \n    expersq + educ)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.41515 -0.29116  0.00905  0.28228  3.05551 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.
